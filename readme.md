3. Code Explanation

The project consists of three main files:

index.html: The HTML file defines the structure of the web page, including the form for user input and the div where the results are displayed.  It also links the CSS stylesheet and the JavaScript file.

style.css: The CSS file styles the HTML elements, controlling the appearance of the page.

app.js: The JavaScript file contains the logic for the application. It listens for form submission, retrieves user input, calculates the zodiac sign, generates random messages, and updates the result div with the personalized insights.  Key aspects include:

Arrays to store zodiac signs, compliments, recommendations, and predictions.
An event listener to handle form submissions.
Functions to get form values and generate messages.
Use of Math.random() to select random messages.
Updating the innerHTML of the result div to display the insights
